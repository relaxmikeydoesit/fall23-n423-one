Note:  I understand that part of the assignment was to implement a doginfo page, and bring in information from thedogapi and display it on the page. I am not sure how to do that...I know that it would need to get the info from the ID of the image, so I would have to dynamically route to the doginfo page, but I am not sure how to do that. I am going to continue to work on it, but I wanted to submit what I have so far. I will resubmit it when I have it completed. Thank you for your understanding.
